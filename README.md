# DSA-Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, organized by common **problem-solving patterns**.

## 📚 Patterns Covered

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **Prefix Sum**
- **Sliding Window**
- **Two Pointers**

Each folder contains problems related to the corresponding algorithmic technique.

## ✨ Purpose

- Reinforce my understanding of DSA patterns.
- Prepare for coding interviews (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces).
- Share structured Java solutions with others.

## 🛠 How to Use

- Browse the folders based on the DSA pattern.
- Each file represents a solution to one problem.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add more patterns (Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Graphs, etc.)
- Include problem links (LeetCode / HackerRank).
- Optimize existing solutions.

## 🛡️ Notes

This repository is made for learning and personal growth.
